<p>There are several pieces to the assessment to receive all 5 points -- all of which will be submitted through Github  by Wed., 10/30/19 - (to be done via a webpage based on a template from our Wk9-Assignments github or you can structure your own page if you'd prefer, but it must include all of these elements), with different headings for the different sections include the following:<p>

 A short (1 to 3 paragaph) reflection in a webpage (via <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></pre> marking up a section of your page, for example) on how libraries support student research in the internet age. Include what you learned from Monday's class. </li>
<li>A "description list" with the 4 aspects of computational thinking listed & briefly summarized (see: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl</a> for more on the <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></pre>element)</li>

<!-- 2.)A short (1 to 3 paragaph) reflection in a webpage (via <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></pre> marking up a section of your page, for example) on how libraries support student research in the internet age. Include what you learned from Monday's class. -->
<h4>Library Resources and the importance of research.</h4>
	 <p>Library resources are important because it is where a vast range of information can be found in a timely manner. CCSU's library is very easy to navigate, as shown inclass today by Joy Hansen, through it's research database. It is very easy to find online resources via the database 
	 as well as physical resources that can be found in the library. I learned today that the library may only have 4 floors, but there are 8 stacks. Each floor has two stacks so floor 1 has stacks 1 and 2, floor 2 has stacks 3 and 4, floor 3 has stacks 5 and 6, and floorf 4 has stacks 7 and 8. 
	 Research in the internet age is important because there is so much information readily avaliable to us. It is important that we do extensive research when we are learning about something so we can rule out fake/incorrect information. There are many places on the internet where the information
	 being provided may not be accurate so it is important to do enough research that you find credible sources.
